1. We should have a Gmail account for using the google cloud.

2. Once we create or login to the gmail account, we can access the google cloud by using the link https://cloud.google.com/
   
3. One logged in we need to give our basic details like phone number, card details etc, kindly remember to turn off automatic renew option.
   
4. Once done the set up we need to search of "vertex ai" option top left expandable side bar.
   
5. It will take us to the following page:

10. We can set or finetune the model by changing the parameters in the advanced tab. I always prefer to keep the temperature as 0.

12. If we want to call this api from anyone of the development tool like VS Code etc then we will get code from the view code option from this site. It will display the code behind.
